```

#### 2. Install all dependencies:

```bash

#### 3. Set up EmailJS for the Contact Form:

To enable the contact form to send emails directly to your Gmail:

1. Go to [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create a free account
2. Set up a **Gmail Service** and connect your Gmail account
3. Create an **Email Template** with these variables:
   - `{{from_name}}` — Visitor's name
   - `{{from_email}}` — Visitor's email
   - `{{message}}` — Visitor's message
4. Copy your credentials and create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
# EmailJS Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_58XXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_8XXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=H6C_kQYyV8SXXXXXX
```

Replace with your actual EmailJS credentials from their dashboard.

# OR using npm
npm run dev

# OR using yarn
yarn dev
```

This starts the development server at `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port if 3000 is in use).

#### 6. Open in your browser:

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see the magic ✨

  },
};
```

### Update Projects

```ts
{
  id: "your-project",
  category: "Category Name",
  title: "Project Title",
  src: "/assets/your-project/logo.png",
  screenshots: ["img1.png", "img2.png"],
  live: "https://your-project.com",
  github: "https://github.com/you/project",
  skills: {
    frontend: [PROJECT_SKILLS.react, PROJECT_SKILLS.tailwind],
    backend: [PROJECT_SKILLS.node, PROJECT_SKILLS.express],
  },
  // Content goes in the get content() method
}
```

### Update Skills & Experience

- **SKILLS** — Add/modify individual skills with icons and descriptions
- **EXPERIENCE** — Add your work experience entries

## ⌨️ Updating the 3D Keyboard Skills

The 3D keyboard keycaps are stored in `public/assets/skills-keyboard.spline`:

1. Open the file in [Spline](https://spline.design/)
2. Unhide keycap objects you want to edit
3. Update logo images on each keycap
4. **Important:** Keycap object names in Spline must match the `name` field in `src/data/constants.ts` (e.g., `js`, `react`, `docker`)
5. Hide keycaps again and export
6. Replace the file in `public/assets/`

Make sure `src/data/constants.ts` has matching entries:

```ts
export const SKILLS: Record<SkillNames, Skill> = {
  js: { name: "js", label: "JavaScript", ... },
  react: { name: "react", label: "React", ... },
  // Must match keycap names in Spline file
};
```
